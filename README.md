# Pumpkinode

Pumpkinode is a little game, written in Node.js, without third party dependencies, to show how the terminal can be manipulated to make a little game/application (same thing).

The code prioritizes simplicity. If you were to build a real game, you'd want to think more about game state and how it can be modified.
